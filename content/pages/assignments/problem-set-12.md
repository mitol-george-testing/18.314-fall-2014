Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. _A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory_. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

Problem Set 12
--------------

*   Due in Session 37
*   Practice Problems
    *   Session 33: Chapter 12: Exercises 1, 3, 4, 10
    *   Session 34: None
    *   Session 35: Chapter 12: Exercise 22
    *   Session 36: Chapter 12: Exercises 7, 8, 9
    *   Session 37: Chapter 13: Exercises 4, 6, 7, 8. By "the space," the author means three-dimensional Euclidean space. (It is common to say "the plane" for the Euclidean plane, but I never heard "the space" before.)
        *   Non-practice" problems, but not to be handed in: Chapter 13: Exercises 20, 24, 38 in 24, the phrase "five persons on the bus who know at least four of the other passengers" means "five persons on the bus, _each_ of whom know at least four of the other passengers". The definition of a permutation of an infinite set _S_ in 38 is vague and incorrect. Regard a permutation of the positive integers as a sequence _a_1, _a_2, ... of positive integers such that every positive integer occurs exactly once. We say that this sequence _contains_ an increasing arithmetic progression of length three if there exist _i_<_j_<_k_ such that _a__i_, _a__j_, _a__k_ is an increasing arithmetic progression.
*   Problems Assigned in the Textbook
    *   Chapter 12: Exercises 13, 18, 19, 20, 21. For 20, note that it is o.k. for _p__a_\=0 or _p__b_\=0.
*   Additional Problems
    *   (A19) Let _n_â‰¥4. Suppose that _P_ is a convex polyhedron with one _n_\-vertex face and two additional vertices. What is the most number of faces that _P_ can have?
    *   (A20) Show that the complete graph _K_7 can be embedded on a torus without crossing edges. Draw the torus as a square (or rectangle) with opposite edges identified.
    *   (A21\*) Find a triangle-free graph (i.e., no three vertices that are pairwise adjacent) with chromatic number four. Try to use as few vertices as possible.
*   Bonus Problems
    *   (B5) Find three states of the United States with the property that there exist three points in common to all three of them. **Note**. Suppose we choose a point in the interior of each of the states and join it to the three intersection points. Why does this not give a planar embedding of _K3,__3_?
