Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. _A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory_. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=TzJ2L9ZmlQUC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

Problem Set 7
-------------

*   Due in Session 19
*   Practice Problems
    *   Session 17: None from textbook
        *   Let _n_≥1, and let _f_(_n_) be the number of partitions of _n_ such that for all _k_, the part _k_ occurs at most _k_ times. Let _g_(_n_) be the number of partitions of _n_ such that no part has the form _i_(_i_+1), i.e., no parts equal to 2, 6, 12, 20, …. Show that _f_(_n_)=_g_(_n_). Use generating functions.
        *   Let _f_(_n_) denote the number of partitions of _n_ with an even number of 1's. Give a combinatorial proof and a generating function proof that _f_(_n_) + _f_(_n_\-1) = _p_(_n_), the total number of partitions of _n_.
    *   Session 18: Chapter 8: Exercises 20, 21
*   Problems Assigned in the Textbook
    *   Chapter 8: Exercises 27, 28, 32, 37\*. In exercise 28, you can ignore the last sentence (about comparing with Exercise 4). **Hint** for 37. Consider the product 1/(1-_qx_)(1-_qx_2)(1-_qx_3)...
*   Additional Problems
    *   (A8\*) Show that the number of partitions of _n_ for which no part appears exactly once is equal to the number of partitions of _n_ for which every part is divisible by 2 or 3. For instance, when _n_\=6 there are four partitions of the first type (111111,2211,222,33) and four of the second type (222, 33, 42, 6). Use generating functions.
    *   (A9) Show that the number of partitions of _n_ for which no part appears more than twice is equal to the number of partitions of _n_ for which no part is divisible by 3. For instance, when _n_\=5 there are five partitions of the first type (5, 41, 32, 311, 221) and five of the second type (5, 41, 221, 2111, 11111). Use generating functions.
*   Bonus Problems
    *   (B2) Find the generating function _G_(_x_) = Σ_n_≥0 an_x__n_/_n_!,  
        where _a__n_+1 = (_n_+1)_a__n_\-{_n_\\choose 2}_a__n_\-2 for _n_≥0, and _a_0\=1.  
        Thus _a_1\=1, _a_2\=2, _a_3\=5. You don't need to find a formula for _a__n_.
