Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. _A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory_. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=TzJ2L9ZmlQUC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

    *   Session 19: None from textbook
        *   A group of _n_ children form circles by holding hands, with a child in the center of each circle. Let _h_(_n_) be the number of ways that this can be done. Set _h_(0)=1. Find a _simple_ expression for the generating function _F_(_x_) = Σ_n_≥0 _h_(_n_)_x__n_/_n_!. A circle may consist of just one child holding his or her own hands, but a child must be in the center of each circle. The clockwise order of the children around the circle matters, so _k_ children can form a circle in (_k_\-1)! ways. Thus _h_(1)=0, _h_(2)=2, _h_(3)=3, _h_(4)=20, _h_(5)=90. Answer: (1-_x_)\-_x_

*   Additional Problems
    *   (A10) Let _f_(_n_) be the number of ways to paint _n_ giraffes either red, blue, yellow, or turquoise, such that an odd number of giraffes are red and an even number are blue. Use exponential generating functions to find a simple formula for _f_(_n_). (It is allowed to have no giraffes painted blue, yellow, or turquoise.)
    *   (A11) Let _f_(_n_) be the number of ways to partition an _n_\-element set, and then to choose a nonempty subset of each block of the partition. Find a simple formula (no infinite sums) for the exponential generating function _G_(_x_) = Σ_n_≥0 _f_(_n_)_x__n_/_n_!.
    *   (A12) Give a simple reason why a 9-vertex simple graph cannot have the degrees of its vertices equal to 8, 8, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 1.
