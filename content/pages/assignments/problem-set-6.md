Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. _A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory_. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011.

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

Problem Set 6
-------------

*   Due in Session 17
*   Practice Problems
    *   Session 14: Chapter 8: Exercises 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 14\*
        *   Additional practice problem: Let _f_(_n_) denote the number of permutations _π_ of 1,2,…,_n_ such that for all 1≤_i_≤_n_ we have π(_i_) = _i_\-1, _i_, _i_+1, or _i_+2. (Set _f_(0)=1.) For instance, _f_(3)=4, the four permutations being 123, 132, 213, 312. Find the generating function _G_(_x_) = Σ_n_≥0 f(_n_)_x__n_. You do not need to find a formula for _f_(_n_). What if we do not allow fixed points, i.e., we exclude π(_i_)=_i_? **Hint.** Consider the digraph of π where we write the vertices 1,2,…,n in a line.
    *   Session 15: None from textbook
        *   (additional practice problem): Suppose we have 2_n_ points on the circumference of a circle. Show that the number of ways we can draw _n noncrossing_ diagonals connecting the points, such that each of the points is an endpoint of one of the diagonals, is equal to the Catalan number _C__n_. Give a bijection with ballot sequences of length 2_n_. (Ballot sequences and Catalan numbers were discussed in class.)
*   Problems Assigned in the Textbook
    *   Chapter 8: Exercises 24, 26, 35. In 24 use generating functions. Do not simply guess the answer and verify that it is correct. In 35, _H__n_ should be _h__n_. Also find a simple explicit formula for _h__n_.
*   Additional Problems
    *   (A7) Let _f_(_n_) be the number of ways to stack pennies against a flat wall as follows: the bottom level consists of a row of _n_ pennies, each tangent to its neighbor(s). A penny may be placed in a higher row if it is supported by two pennies below it. Here is ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[an example (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit18_314f14_pennies) for _n_\=10 and for all five possibilities when _n_\=3. Show that _f_(_n_)=_C__n_, a Catalan number. (One of many methods is to give a bijection with the Dyck paths discussed in class.)
